I’m Maako Fangajei, an electrical engineering student at Georgia Tech with interests spanning sensing, signal processing, and robotics—especially where technology meets human impact. My work and studies explore how engineering can inform public policy and law, from biomedical innovation to equitable tech regulation. I’m also drawn to interdisciplinary problem-solving, whether it’s designing circuits, building with my team in the makerspace, or debating in mock trial. Growing up between the U.S., Switzerland, and Ghana has shaped how I think about community and responsibility—values I carry into everything I build and pursue.
